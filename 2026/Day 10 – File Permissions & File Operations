Day 10 – File Permissions & File Operations 

Today’s challenge focused on creating, reading, and managing file permissions
in Linux — an important skill for system administration and DevOps work.

Learned how to:
- Create and edit files
- Read files using Linux commands
- Understand permission structure
- Modify permissions using chmod

Test permission errors
📄 Files Created
- devops.txt
- notes.txt
- script.sh

. ✔️ Verified using ls -l
- 🧾 File Creation
- Create Empty File
- touch devops.txt

. Create File With Content
- echo "Linux file permissions are important for security." > notes.txt
- Create Script Using Vim
- vim script.sh
- echo "Hello DevOps"

. 📖 Reading Files
- cat notes.txt
- vim -R script.sh
- head -n 5 /etc/passwd
- tail -n 5 /etc/passwd


🔐 Understanding Permission

Permission Format:
rwxrwxrwx
Owner | Group | Others
Permission
Value
Read
4
Write
2
Execute
1

. Check Permissions:
- ls -l devops.txt notes.txt script.sh

⚙️ Permission Changes
- Make Script Executable
- chmod +x script.sh
- ./script.sh
- Make devops.txt Read-Only

- chmod 640 notes.txt
- Create Directory With 755 Permission
- mkdir project
- chmod 755 project

🎯 What I Learned
- Linux file access depends on permissions
- Numeric permissions simplify access control
- Execute permission is required to run scripts
- ls -l helps verify permissions
